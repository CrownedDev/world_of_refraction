# PIE checks — what to play-test, and how

Automated tests (`Scripts/ue/test.sh`) prove the logic. This folder holds what still needs **eyes and hands in PIE** (look, feel, flow), so Crown can test at leisure instead of when the work lands.

## How it works
- **One file per job:** `B-xxx.md`, written by Claude Code at hand-off (Backlog mode step 5) — or by a cloud session when it hands work over.
- Each file lists numbered checks: **what to do**, **what you should see**, and a result box.
- Crown ticks results in the file (or tells Claude, who ticks them):
  - `[ ]` not tested yet · `[x]` passed · `[!]` failed — write what happened underneath.
- A job's PIE file being all `[x]` is the signal it's ready for `dev → main`.
- A `[!]` becomes a new backlog job (or reopens the old one) — Claude reads the notes.

Move rows to **Done** when every check passes.
